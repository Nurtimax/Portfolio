# Nurtilek's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases some of my projects and skills in web development, with a primary focus on Next.js, React, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

## Projects

### Project 1: Gadgetarium
- Gadgetarium is an online store where users can browse and purchase products, add them to their cart, create a list of favorite items, and compare them. The store administrator has the ability to manage products, including adding, modifying, and removing items, as well as handling discounts and order statuses.

- The website offers users a diverse range of products available for purchase and features filtering and sorting options to simplify the search for desired items. Additionally, users can track the status of their orders and view delivery information, including delivery status.

- The system also provides the store administrator with graphics and product management tools for convenient assortment control. For user convenience, the system allows adding products to a favorites list and comparing them, aiding in making more informed purchasing decisions.

- Technologies Used: **React** *JavaScript* date-fns, @mui/material, @pbe/react-yandex-maps, @reduxjs/toolkit, axios, formik, framer-motion, framer-motion, jodit-react, notistack, react-color, react-content-loader, react-dropzone, react-icons, react-input-mask, react-input-mask, react-payment-inputs, react-player, react-redux, react-responsive-carousel, react-router-dom, react-scroll, react-scroll, react-table, react-toastify, redux-persist, slick-carousel, use-debounce,use-react-router-breadcrumbs, uuid, yup, eslint, eslint.

### Project 2: Financial planner

- Financial-Planner is a program that assists the user in budget planning and financial management. It includes functionality that enables the user to calculate their monthly expenses and income, as well as obtain an overall view of their finances over a selected period.

- Additionally, Financial-Planner can be used as a calculator to perform various financial calculations, such as interest calculations for loans or deposits, inflation calculations, and more.

- Specifically, to calculate the amount for one month, the user can input their income and expenses for that period, and the program will automatically calculate the remaining funds at the end of the month. To calculate the total amount for the month, the user can input data for several months, and the program will sum up all income and expenses over that period, providing an overall picture of their finances for that period.

- Technologies Used: **React** *Typescript*, date-fns, dayjs, dotenv, firebase, formik, lodash, node-telegram-bot-api, numeral, prettier, react-draggable, react-helmet, react-helmet-async, react-redux, react-router-dom, react-table, redux-persist, ts-node, yup, use-react-router-breadcrumbs,

### Project 3: Bilingual
- Bilingual is a web service designed for creating and taking tests in two languages (e.g., English and another language). Users can create their own tests, consisting of questions and answer options in each language, as well as customize test parameters (e.g., time limits). Additionally, Bilingual offers the capability to take voice tests, where users can record their answers to questions using a microphone.

- Users can take tests on both computers and mobile devices, providing convenience in using the service under various conditions. Bilingual supports two types of users: administrators and regular users. Administrators can manage tests, add new users, remove old ones, and monitor user activity.

- Bilingual serves as an interactive language learning platform that allows users to assess their language skills and progress, as well as improve their communication abilities in different languages.
- 
- Technologies Used: **Next.js** *TypeScript* next-auth, next-router-mock, react-redux, redux-persist, stream-browserify, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, three, babel-loader, css-loader, css-loader, file-loader, html-webpack-plugin, prettier, storybook, style-loader, ts-loader, ts-loader, @reduxjs/toolkit, @mui/material, bcryptjs, cookie, crypto-browserify.
